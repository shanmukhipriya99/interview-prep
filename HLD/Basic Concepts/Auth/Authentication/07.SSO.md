## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials (username and password). SSO simplifies the user experience by reducing the number of passwords a user has to manage and remember.

Personal computers are classic examples of an SSO system i.e., you enter password once and get access to all the apps. Google is another classic example you login to Gmail and get to use all the GDrive apps that comes along with it.

### How does it work?

- Let’s say you are trying to access Google forms. Google sends a request to the forms, the forms of service inturns calls an authentication service to make sure that the current user is logged in.
- If the person is already logged in present with the information.
- If not show him a login screen to authenticate the user.

### Advantages

- User Convenience: Users only need to remember one set of credentials, making it easier to manage access to multiple applications or services.
  Users don’t have to repeatedly enter credentials when accessing various services, improving the user experience.
- Reduced Password Fatigue: Reduces the cognitive load on users who would otherwise have to remember multiple passwords for different services.
- Reduced Helpdesk Costs: With fewer passwords to remember, there’s likely to be fewer password reset requests, reducing the workload on helpdesks and IT support.
- Streamlined User Experience: Users can navigate between different systems or services seamlessly without being prompted for credentials multiple times.
- Improved Security: Centralizing the authentication process can make it easier to implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  Reduces the risk associated with password reuse across multiple services.

### Disdvantages

- Single Point of Failure: If the SSO system is compromised, attackers could gain access to all the services and applications connected to the SSO.
  The centralized nature of SSO makes it a lucrative target for attackers.
- Complex Implementation: Implementing SSO can be complex and requires careful planning to ensure all systems can integrate with the SSO solution.
  Different services may use different authentication mechanisms, making integration challenging.
- Vendor Lock-in: Organizations may become dependent on a single SSO provider, making it difficult to switch providers or implement different authentication solutions.
- Potential for Broader Impact of Compromised Credentials: If a user’s SSO credentials are compromised, multiple services are at risk, amplifying the potential damage.
- Dependency on Network Access: If the SSO system becomes unreachable due to network issues, it could prevent users from accessing multiple services.

### Types of attacks:

1. #### Phishing Attacks

   Attackers deceive users into providing their SSO credentials by mimicking the SSO login page.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker creates a fake SSO login page.
   Users are tricked into visiting this page and entering their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker.

   _Example:_
   An attacker sends an email to users claiming to be from the IT department, asking them to log in to a new service, providing a link to the fake SSO login page.

2. #### Session Hijacking (Token Kidnapping)

   Attackers steal a user’s session token, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker exploits vulnerabilities or uses malware to capture the user’s session token.
   The token is then used to access the user’s accounts.

   _Example:_
   An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Wi-Fi network to capture session tokens of users accessing services via SSO.

3. #### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

   Attackers trick users into performing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker creates a malicious site or link that generates forged requests to the SSO-enabled application.
   Unsuspecting users who click on the link execute these forged requests unknowingly.

   _Example:_
   A user logged into an SSO-enabled application clicks on a malicious link, inadvertently triggering a forged request that changes their email address in the application.

4. #### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

   Attackers intercept communication between the user and the SSO system to steal credentials or session tokens.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker positions themselves between the user and the SSO system, capturing information transmitted between them.

   _Example:_
   An attacker intercepts communication on an insecure Wi-Fi network, capturing SSO credentials or tokens of users accessing services.

5. #### SSO Service Provider (SP) Impersonation

   Attackers impersonate a legitimate service provider to receive authentication assertions or tokens from the identity provider (IdP).

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker sets up a fake service provider and tricks the IdP into sending authentication assertions or tokens to it.

   _Example:_
   An attacker creates a fake application that mimics a legitimate service, registers it with the IdP, and receives authentication assertions or tokens meant for the legitimate service.

6. #### Identity Provider (IdP) Impersonation

   Attackers impersonate the IdP to issue fraudulent authentication assertions or tokens.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker sets up a fake IdP and tricks the service provider into accepting authentication assertions or tokens from it.

   _Example:_
   An attacker creates a fake IdP, and when users try to access a service, they are redirected to the fake IdP, which issues fraudulent tokens or assertions.

7. #### XML Signature Wrapping Attacks

   Specific to SAML-based SSO, attackers manipulate XML signatures to trick the service provider into accepting malicious content.

   ##### Mechanism:

   The attacker modifies the SAML assertion, wrapping the original signature with a new, malicious XML element.

   _Example:_
   An attacker intercepts a SAML assertion, modifies it to grant themselves elevated privileges, and then sends it to the service provider, which processes the malicious assertion.

### Defense against the attacks:

- Use Anti-Phishing Tools: Implement anti-phishing tools that can help in identifying and blocking phishing websites and emails.
- Secure Connections: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- Secure Cookies: Set cookies with the HttpOnly and Secure attributes to prevent them from being accessed by malicious scripts.
- Anti-CSRF Tokens: Implement anti-CSRF tokens in forms to ensure that received requests are intentional.
- SameSite Cookie Attribute: Use the SameSite cookie attribute to prevent cookies from being sent in cross-site requests.
- HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and ensure data integrity.
- Certificate Pinning: Implement certificate pinning to ensure that the application communicates only with the intended server.
- Strong Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms between the IdP and SPs.
- Validate Metadata: Ensure that the metadata of the SPs is validated and trusted.
- Certificate Validation: Ensure that the SP validates the certificate of the IdP.
- Whitelisting: Only allow known and trusted IdPs to participate in the SSO process.
- Strong Validation: Implement strong validation of SAML assertions and XML signatures.
- Schema Validation: Perform schema validation to ensure that the received XML documents conform to the expected structure.

### Stateful SSO VS Stateless SSO

#### Stateful SSO:

In a stateful SSO implementation, the SSO server or Identity Provider (IdP) maintains a session for the user after the initial authentication.
When a user tries to access another application, the application redirects the user to the SSO server to check for an existing session.
If a valid session exists, the SSO server provides the necessary tokens or credentials to access the application, avoiding the need for the user to log in again.

#### Stateless SSO:

In a stateless SSO implementation, the SSO server does not maintain a session. Instead, it generates a token (like a JWT) that contains the necessary user information and is signed by the SSO server.
This token is then passed to the applications, and the applications can verify the user’s identity and authentication status based on the token itself without needing to communicate back with the SSO server.
The applications need to have a way to validate the integrity and authenticity of the token, usually by using a public key provided by the SSO server.

#### Comparison:

- Scalability: Stateless SSO tends to be more scalable because it doesn’t require the SSO server to maintain session information, reducing the server's load and resource consumption.

- Flexibility: Stateless SSO is more flexible and easier to manage in distributed and microservices architectures because it doesn’t rely on a centralized session store.

- Security: Stateful SSO might offer a slightly higher security level because it allows for more immediate control over sessions, enabling quick revocation of sessions if necessary.

#### Conclusion:

Whether SSO is stateful or stateless depends on the implementation. Stateless SSO implementations are becoming more common due to their scalability and flexibility benefits, especially in modern, distributed application architectures.

### OAuth VS SSO

This sounds similar to oauth but, the major difference is Oauth allows only specific access to an app whereas SSO provides complete access of the data available

#### Advantages

- Talk about user experience your user needs to remember only one set of password
- Secure, since a single service is holding your password and is responsible for its security

#### Disadvantages

- Single point of failure: When an authentication service goes down all the app relying on it cannot be accessed
- Any security breach in the authentication system will open access to a wide set of apps and data.
