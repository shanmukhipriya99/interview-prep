## Token-Based Authentication (Stateless)

Token Based Authentication is a form of stateless authentication. Instead of sending email and password over for authentication we use a server generated token. Oauth, JWT, Open ID all comes under token-based authentication.
Auth tokens can be hardware or software-based. Some types of authentication tokens include:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (i.e., bearer tokens, self-signed JWTs)
- Refresh tokens
- Federated tokens
- One-time password (OTP) tokens
- API tokens

### How Does it Work?

When the client submits login credentials, the server:

- verifies the credentials against the DB,
- generates a temporary **token** & embeds user data (payload) into it (also stores the token in the DB),
- responds back with the token (in body or header)
  The token is stored in the client storage and sends the token along with each request. The server validates the token against the registered token in the database & grants access. When the client logs out, the token is cleared from the client storage.

`Note: If the token on the client storage is deleted, the client would have re-authenticate themselves.`

- The server signs the token with a secret (private key) to prevent manipulation by the client.
- The tokens can be opaque (payload contains no user-identifying info) or self-contained (payload contains info that can be used to identify user)
- Typically sent in `Authorization` header.
- When a token is about to expire, it can be refreshed i.e. if the client is issued both access & refresh tokens.

### Advantages

- The server no longer has to bear the overhead of session information.
- No more CSRF. With token based auth you are dealing with a bunch of APIs consumed by different clients.
- Works well on microservices architecture.
- Scalability: Authentication tokens are easily scalable and self-contained, providing all the information needed for authentication. This is great for scalability as it frees your server from having to store session state.
- Flexibility: Authentication tokens can be generated from anywhere.
- Security: Auth tokens provide an extra layer of security and can be expired. They provide better protection against attack scenarios like brute-force attacks or stolen passwords.
- Easier to Implement Single Sign-On (SSO): With token-based authentication, implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) becomes more straightforward. Once a user is authenticated and receives a token, this token can be used to access other services within the same ecosystem without requiring the user to log in again.

### Disadvantages

- Cannot revoke the access to a user.
- The safety of the token relies on the consumer of the token, often in cookies, local storage, or session storage. Each storage method has its vulnerabilities, with local and session storage being susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Types of token-based attacks:

- #### Token Interception:

  Unauthorized interception of the token during transmission.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when tokens are transmitted over non-secure channels or when they're stored insecurely on the client side.

  _Example:_ A user logs into a web application that uses JWT for authentication. The token is transmitted over HTTP (instead of HTTPS), and an attacker eavesdrops on the network traffic, capturing the token.

- #### Token Replay Attack:

  An attacker reuses a token to gain unauthorized access.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when the server doesn't have a mechanism to differentiate between a genuine token and a replayed token.

  _Example:_ An attacker intercepts a token and uses it to access the system, impersonating the legitimate user.

- #### Token Tampering:

  Modifying the token to alter its meaning.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when the token's integrity isn't protected, allowing an attacker to modify the token payload and then use it.

  _Example:_ An attacker changes the `role` claim in a JWT from `user` to `admin` to elevate privileges.

- #### Weak Signature/Brute Force Attack:

  Exploiting weak algorithms or keys used to sign the token.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when the server trusts tokens signed with weak algorithms or when the private signing key is compromised.

  _Example:_ A server is configured to trust tokens signed with the `none` algorithm. An attacker crafts a token with this algorithm and gains unauthorized access.

- #### Token Disclosure:

  Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information within the token.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when sensitive data is stored in the token payload without proper encryption.

  _Example:_ A JWT contains the user's email and home address in its payload. An attacker intercepts the token and can now view this information.

- #### Missing Token:

  The application allows requests without tokens or with invalid tokens.

  ##### Mechanism:

  Occurs when the server doesn't properly validate the presence and validity of tokens for each protected endpoint.

  _Example:_ An attacker accesses a protected API endpoint without providing any token and the server processes the request.

- #### Lack of Token Revocation:
  One of the challenges with stateless JWTs is that they can't be revoked easily before they expire.

### Defense against token-based attacks:

- Implement a token blacklist on the server-side, although this somewhat negates the stateless benefit. Alternatively, use short-lived tokens and implement a refresh token mechanism.
- Always use HTTPS for transmitting tokens.
- Avoid storing tokens in easily accessible storage like `localStorage` due to the potential for XSS attacks.
- Implement token expiration. Short-lived tokens are less likely to be useful to an attacker.
- Use one-time use tokens where applicable.
- Always use a strong signing algorithm (like RS256) to ensure the token's integrity.
- Avoid using weak or none algorithms for JWT. Don't trust tokens with the `none` algorithm.
- Regularly rotate signing keys.
- Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the token.
- If necessary, encrypt the token payload.
- Implement proper error handling for missing or invalid tokens.

### Types of Authentication Tokens:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): It defines a simple, self-contained method for transmitting information between parties securely. The JWT standard uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects to transmit tokens between parties. These tokens can be used for authentication, and to transfer additional information about the user or account.

  Because of their small size, JWTs can be sent as URLs, POST parameters, or HTTP headers, and can be transmitted quickly. The JWT contains all the necessary information about the entity, to avoid multiple queries to the database. The JWT receiver doesn’t need to call the server to validate the token.

  A JWT is composed of three parts:

  - A **header**, which includes the type of token and the encryption algorithm it uses.
  - A **payload**, which provides authentication credentials and other information about the user or account.
  - A **signature**, which includes a cryptographic key that can be used to validate the authenticity of the information in the payload.

- Refresh Tokens: A refresh token is a special kind of token used in token-based authentication systems to obtain a new access token. Unlike the access token, which is used to grant users direct access to a system or application, the refresh token is used to renew an expired access token without requiring the user to log in again.

  Typically, access tokens have a short lifespan for security reasons. When an access token expires, the system can use the refresh token to acquire a new one, ensuring prolonged user sessions and enhancing user experience. Importantly, refresh tokens are usually long-lived and stored securely, as their compromise could enable potential unauthorized access.

- Federated Tokens: Federated tokens are authentication credentials issued by an identity provider (IdP) that allow users to access multiple systems or services without separately logging into each one. This form of token is part of federated identity management, where user identities are trusted across multiple IT systems or organizations.

  When a user first logs in, the IdP validates their identity and provides tokens that other systems trust. For instance, if you’ve ever logged into a service using your Google or Facebook account, you’ve used federated identity. The tokens prove your identity to other services without requiring you to enter your credentials again, simplifying access and enhancing user experience across diverse platforms.

- One-Time Password (OTP) Tokens: One-time password (OTP) tokens are secure hardware devices or software programs that can generate one-time passwords. Most commonly, these are personal identification numbers (PIN), numeric codes between 4-12 digits.
  One-time password tokens enhance existing identity and password systems by adding dynamically generated credentials. Depending on the provider, OTP tokens generate PINs either synchronously or asynchronously:

  - _Synchronous tokens_ use your private key and the current time to create a one-time password.
  - _Asynchronous tokens_ use Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (CRAM), a group of protocols in which the server presents a challenge, and the token must generate the correct answer.

- API Tokens: API Tokens are used as unique identifiers of an application requesting access to your service. Your service then generates an API token for the application to use when requesting your service. The API Token can then be matched with the one you have stored to authenticate and provide access. You can implement a Session ID in some use cases, but that is basically a very specific deviation.

  API tokens have gained popularity as they replace the unsafe practice of sending username and password combinations over HTTP. OAuth2 (access tokens) is one of the most common ways of implementing API security today.

- Hardware Tokens (USB Tokens): Hardware tokens are physical devices that enable the authorization of users to access protected networks. The purpose of a hardware token is to add a layer of security via two-factor or multi-factor authentication (2FA or MFA). The token owner links the token to the system or service they want to access. Hardware tokens are designed for user experience and customizability, so they can come in multiple forms. The most common types of tokens are key fobs and USB or wireless tokens. Hardware tokens can be divided into three categories: _Contactless_, _Disconnected_, and _Connected_.
