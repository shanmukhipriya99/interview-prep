## Cookie/Session-Based Authentication

Cookie/Session based authentication is the most commonly used in web apps. Both session and cookie implementation are not exactly the same but conceptually, the client uses either a cookie/session to identify themselves as logged in.

### Session-Based Authentication (Stateful)

#### How Does it Work?

When the client submits login credentials, the server:

- verifies the credentials against the DB,
- creates a temporary user **session** (session data is stored server-side),
- sends the **session ID** (long, random meaningless string) to the client.

  Then, each time the client makes a request to the server, the session ID is also sent along, and the server validates it against the session data & grants access. When the client logs out, the server destroys the session and the session ID on the browser is cleared.

  `Note: If the session info in the server is deleted, the session ID from the client is meaningless.`

  Every user session is stored server-side making it **stateful**:

  - memory; ex: file system
  - cache; ex: Redis, Memcached, etc
  - DB; ex: SQL, MongoDB, etc

### Cookie-Based Authentication (Stateless)

#### How Does it Work?

When the client submits login credentials, the server:

- verifies the credentials against the DB,
- generates a **session cookie** and sends it to the client.

  Then, each time the client makes a request to the server, the session cookie is also sent along, and the server uses the session cookie to identify the user and authenticate them. When the client logs out, the session cookie on the browser is cleared.

  - In this case, the cookie stores the session ID and user info. This cookie is stored on the client-side and is signed by the server before sending to prevent manipulation on the client-side.

- `Cookie` header, just like `Authorization` or `Content-Type`
- used for session management, personalization, tracking
- consists of **name**, **value**, and (optional) **attributes** / **flags**
- set with `Set-Cookie` by server, appended with `Cookie` by browser

  ##### Session Management:

  - Session Timeout: Sessions should have an expiration time to reduce the window of opportunity for attacks.
  - Session Renewal: Upon successful authentication, it's a good practice to renew the session ID to prevent session fixation attacks.
  - Session Storage: Consider the implications of where sessions are stored. For instance, storing sessions in memory might not be feasible for large-scale applications or applications that need to maintain state across server restarts.

### Advantages

- We no longer set the password in every request making the window for attacks smaller.
- Can revoke the validity of a session anytime.
- Enables state maintenance in a stateless system. Cookies maintain the state that the user is already logged in.
- Session IDs are naturally small in size. This small size makes it efficient for storage on the client-side.

### Disadvantages:

- Cookie based authentication is suitable only for Single domain system. If you want both a web and a mobile app or may be a separate client server, then you got to deal with CSRF.
- Prone to XSS and CSRF attacks since the cookie is available for other apps to read.
- You need to store the session information in a DB which also brings in the question of scale.

Cookie-based authentication is simpler to implement and can be more efficient. However, it is also more susceptible to session hijacking and cookie theft.

Session-based authentication is more secure because it is less susceptible to session hijacking and cookie theft. However, it is also more complex and expensive to implement than cookie-based authentication.

If security is a top priority, then session-based authentication is a better choice. However, if performance is a top priority, then cookie-based authentication is a better choice.

In some cases, it may be beneficial to use a hybrid approach that combines elements of both cookie-based authentication and session-based authentication. For example, an application could use cookie-based authentication for initial login and then switch to session-based authentication once the user is logged in. This approach can provide a good balance of security and performance.

### Types of session-based attacks:

- #### Session Hijacking Attack
  In this attack, a hacker takes over a user's browser session to get personal information and passwords. One common way is for the hacker to use **packet sniffers** to access the info being sent and received between the user and server. This information is then used to get private info or log in to the account.
- #### Session Prediction Attack
  Session prediction is an attack technique used to hijack or impersonate a web or application user. The attack focuses on predicting session ID values that permit an attacker to bypass the authentication method of an application. By analyzing and understanding the session ID generation process, an attacker can predict a valid session ID value and get access to the application.

  To achieve this an attacker needs to collect some valid session ID values that are used to identify authenticated users. Then, the attacker must understand the structure of session ID, the information that is used to create it, and the encryption or hash algorithm used by the application to protect it. By studying the characteristics of the session ID the attacker can predict legitimate session IDs.

  In addition, the attacker can implement a brute force technique to generate and test different values of session ID until they successfully get access to the application. The attacker can
  then use the falsified session ID to access the target system.
- #### Session Fixation Attack
  Session fixation is a web-based attack technique where an attacker tricks the user into opening a URL with a predefined session identifier. While there are many ways to do this, a session fixation attack usually needs to successfully execute three operations:
  - Obtain a valid session ID for the targeted application
  - Trick the victim into authenticating using that predefined ID
  - Access the application to impersonate the victim
- #### Session Sidejacking Attack
  Session sidejacking takes advantage of an unencrypted communication channel between a victim and target system. The attacker sniffs traffic on a network looking for session tokens in unencrypted traffic. Once a session token is captured, the attacker performs malicious actions by using the stolen token on the targeted application to impersonate the victim.
- #### Session Replay Attack
  Session replay attacks are network attacks that maliciously “repeat” or “delay” a valid data transmission. A hacker can do this by intercepting a session and stealing a user’s unique session ID (stored as either a cookie, URL, or form field). Now, the hacker is able to masquerade himself or herself as an authorized user, and he or she will be granted full access to do anything that the authorized user can do on a website.
- #### Session Spoofing Attack
  In this attack, the hacker doesn't have to take the victim offline during the attack. The hacker impersonates a machine or a person who might be on vacation and so the victim may be completely unaware of the attack.

### Defense against session-based attacks:

- Implement safe, unguessable session IDs.
- Make HTTPs mandatory for all pages.
- Modify the session ID after user logs in.
- Log out inactive users & invalidate session IDs after a certain period of time.
- Apply HTTP strict transport security (HSTS): This forces web sessions to use TLS encryption, preventing sensitive information from being accessed in transit.

### Types of cookie-based attacks:

- #### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  CSRF is a **Client-side vulnerability**. CSRF is an attack where an attacker tricks a victim into performing actions on a website where the victim is authenticated, without the victim's knowledge or consent.

  If an application is vulnerable to CSRF, the attacker can use any social engineering method on the authenticated user and force him to execute an unwanted action on the web application. Now when this authenticated user is a “privileged user”, the attacker can compromise the entire application easily.

  ##### Mechanism:

  - The attacker creates a malicious site or script that generates requests to a target site where the victim is authenticated.
  - If the victim visits the attacker's malicious site (or a site with the embedded malicious script) while being logged into the target site, the malicious script can make requests to the target site on behalf of the victim, leveraging the victim's authenticated session.

  _Example:_ Suppose a user is logged into their online banking account. If they visit a malicious site that triggers a fund transfer from the user's bank account to the attacker's account, the bank might process the request thinking it's legitimate since it's coming with the user's authenticated session.
- #### Cookie poisoning
  Cookie poisoning, also known as cookie tampering, is an attack where an attacker modifies the contents of a cookie to gain unauthorized information or access.

  ##### Mechanism

  - The attacker intercepts the cookie during its transmission or accesses it from a compromised client machine.
  - The attacker then modifies the cookie's content, such as changing user roles, user IDs, or other data stored in the cookie.
  - The tampered cookie is then sent back to the server in subsequent requests, leading the server to perform actions based on the poisoned cookie's content.

  _Example:_ If a cookie contains a parameter like `user_role=guest`, an attacker might change it to `user_role=admin` to gain administrative privileges on a web application.
- #### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  XSS is a vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When exploited in the context of cookie-based authentication, it can lead to the theft of session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate the victim on the web application.

  ##### Mechanism

  - An attacker finds a vulnerability in a web application that allows them to inject malicious scripts.
  - This script is then executed by another user's browser when they view the compromised page.
  - The malicious script can access any cookies associated with its site and send them to the attacker.

  _Example:_ An attacker inserts a script in the comments section of a blog. When another user views the comment, the script runs and sends their session cookie to the attacker.
- #### Cookie Hijacking
  Similar to session hijacking
- #### Cookie Injection from Related Hostnames:
  Cookie injection from related hostnames refers to an attack where cookies set for a parent domain are injected or forced upon its subdomains, potentially leading to various security issues, including session fixation or overriding legitimate cookies.

  ##### Mechanism
  - Web browsers allow cookies set for a parent domain (e.g., `example.com`) to be accessible by its subdomains (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
  - If an attacker can control or compromise one subdomain, they can set or inject cookies for the parent domain, which will then be sent by the browser to all other subdomains.

  *Example:* Let's say a user regularly visits `secure.example.com` for sensitive operations and `blog.example.com` for reading articles.
  An attacker finds a vulnerability in `blog.example.com` and sets a cookie for `.example.com` (the leading dot means it's valid for all subdomains).
  The next time the user visits `secure.example.com`, their browser sends the attacker's injected cookie along with any legitimate cookies. Depending on the application's behavior and the cookie's attributes, this could lead to various security issues.
- #### Cookie Eviction
  Cookie eviction refers to the process by which older cookies are removed or "evicted" by web browsers when the maximum limit of cookies for a particular domain or overall storage limit is reached.

  ##### Mechanism
  - Web browsers impose limits on the number of cookies that can be stored per domain and the total number of cookies overall. These limits vary by browser.
  - When the limit for a specific domain is reached, and a new cookie is set for that domain, the browser will evict one or more of the oldest cookies for that domain to make space for the new cookie.
  - Similarly, when the overall cookie storage limit is reached, the browser will start evicting the oldest cookies, regardless of the domain, to make space for new ones.

  *Example:* Let's say a browser allows a maximum of 50 cookies per domain.
  A user visits example.com, which sets numerous cookies for tracking, preferences, sessions, etc. Over time, the number of cookies from example.com reaches the limit of 50.
  On a subsequent visit, when example.com tries to set a new cookie, the browser will evict the oldest cookie from example.com to make space for the new one.
  If the overall limit of cookies stored in the browser is reached, the browser will start evicting the oldest cookies from any domain to accommodate new ones.

### Defense against cookie-based attacks:

- Using the HttpOnly and SameSite tags when setting cookie headers prevents them from XSS and CSRF attacks, respectively.
- Implement all the required cookie security attributes such as HTTPOnly & Secure (prevents cookie hijacking).
- Ensure that plain cookies are not used to define the privileges. For example, sending role parameters to define privilege should not be implemented.
- To prevent tampering, encrypt the cookie contents using powerful encryption methods.
  - Sign cookies with a secret key on the server-side. Before processing the cookie's content, verify its signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
- To stop replay attacks, give each cookie a special identification number.
- In stateless apps or other situations where cookies are inappropriate, take into account utilizing a token-based strategy as an alternative to cookies for authentication.
- Use anti-CSRF tokens in forms. These tokens are random values that are checked with every state-changing request to ensure the request is intentional.
- Ensure that state-changing operations require POST requests instead of GET requests.
- Input Validation: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized before they are processed or displayed. This can prevent malicious scripts from being injected into the web application.
- Output Encoding: When displaying user-generated content, use proper encoding to ensure that any scripts are treated as plain text and not executed.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP to restrict the execution of scripts to trusted sources only. This can prevent the execution of malicious scripts even if they are injected into the web page.
- VPN: Utilize Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to create a secure encrypted tunnel for data transmission.
- Session Timeout: Implement short session timeouts, so even if a session cookie is hijacked, it's only valid for a limited time.
- Restrict Cookie Scope: Always set cookies to the most specific domain possible. Instead of setting a cookie for `.example.com`, set it for `secure.example.com` if it's only needed there.
- Secure Subdomains: Ensure that all subdomains are as secure as the main domain. An insecure subdomain can compromise the security of the entire domain.
- Use the `__Host-` Prefix: Cookies with names starting with `__Host-` must be set with the `Secure` attribute, must not have a `Domain` attribute, and the path must be set to `/`. This ensures that the cookie is only sent to the issuing origin and not to any subdomains.
- HSTS with `includeSubDomains`: The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header with the `includeSubDomains` directive ensures that browsers only connect to the domain and its subdomains using HTTPS, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject cookies.
- Prioritize Essential Cookies: Ensure that essential cookies, such as those used for authentication or user preferences, are refreshed or updated regularly, so they are less likely to be evicted.
- Limit Cookie Usage: Only set cookies that are necessary for the application's functionality.
