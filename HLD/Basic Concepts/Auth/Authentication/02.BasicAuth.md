## Basic Authentication (Stateless)

It is the simplest of authentication mechanisms. It is a part of HTTP protocol. It is a challenge response scheme where the server challenges the client to provide necessary information to access the resource

#### How does it work?

- Get the username and password from user
- Encode it using `base64` algorithm
- Set it in the Authorization header and send it along with each HTTP Request.
  `Authorization: Basic XAAUVBBhHI87IO==`

#### Advantages

- Easy and simple to implement
- APIs are faster since there is no complex encryption/decryption involved

#### Disadvantages

- Basic Auth implemented in a non-SSL (HTTPS) network is a huge security vulnerability. It is easy to decode `base64`.
- Sending passwords over every HTTP request provides a pool of requests for attackers to pick passwords from. Once they crack one the system becomes open for attacks.

#### Most common basic authentication vulnerabilities:

- Weak passwords: Basic authentication relies on users to create strong passwords, but many users choose weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack.
- Brute force attacks: Attackers can use brute force attacks to try to guess a user's password. This type of attack is particularly effective against weak passwords.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: If basic authentication is used over an unencrypted connection, attackers can intercept the user's credentials and use them to gain access to the user's account.
- Replay attacks: Attackers can replay captured basic authentication credentials to gain access to a user's account.
- Credential stuffing: Attackers can use stolen credentials from other websites to try to log in to accounts on the target website.

##### Defense
- Using strong passwords: Users should be required to create strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
- Using two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code from their phone in addition to their password.
- Using HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and the server, which protects the user's credentials from being intercepted by attackers.
- Limiting login attempts: The number of login attempts should be limited to prevent brute force attacks.
- Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF can help to protect against a variety of web attacks, including basic authentication attacks.
