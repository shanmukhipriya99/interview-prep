## Digest-Based Authentication (Stateless)

It is an upgraded version of Basic auth. It overcomes the security vulnerabilities of Basic auth over an HTTP network. We no longer deal with `base64` encoded strings, instead the server provides a digest for the client to use while encoding the username and password.

In digest-based auth we no longer have to worry about the universally known base64 encoded string.

`Note: This doesnâ€™t mean it is ok to send passwords over non-HTTP network, it provides just a safety net if you do so.`

#### How does it work?

- Request a server for a resource with no auth
- Server sets the header with certain digest information
- Get the username and password from user
- Hash the username and password along with the digest & send it to the server.
- Server decodes the string with the digest and authorizes the user.

#### Advantages

- Prevents passwords sent as plain-texts
- Avoids Phising

#### Disadvantages

- Digest method is still vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.
- Client has to make 2 calls to get a resource, one to get digest information and another to login.
- Requires more computation on the client and server side.

#### Most common digest-based authentication vulnerabilities:

- Man-in-the-middle attacks: If digest-based authentication is used over an unencrypted connection, attackers can intercept the communication between the client and the server and modify the challenge or the response. This can allow the attacker to gain access to the user's account.
- Replay attacks: Attackers can replay captured digest-based authentication credentials to gain access to a user's account.
- Credential stuffing: Attackers can use stolen credentials from other websites to try to log in to accounts on the target website.

#### Defense

- Using HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and the server, which protects the user's credentials from being intercepted by attackers.
- Using a web application firewall (WAF): A WAF can help to protect against a variety of web attacks, including digest-based authentication attacks.
- Using strong passwords: Users should be required to create strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
- Using two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code from their phone in addition to their password.
- Use a strong hash function: The hash function used to generate the digest should be strong and resistant to attack.
- Use a salt: A salt is a random value that is added to the password before it is hashed. This makes it more difficult for attackers to crack the password.
- Update the challenge frequently: The challenge should be updated frequently to prevent replay attacks.
- Limit the number of login attempts: The number of login attempts should be limited to prevent brute force attacks.
