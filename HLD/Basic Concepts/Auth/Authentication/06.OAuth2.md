## OAuth2

Oauth2 is an advanced version of Token based authorization. Ex: we use Facebook/Google/Twitter to sign-in to an application.

### How does it work?

- User sends an authentication request to say Google/Facebook.
- On finding that the user has an account on Google, the Google server responds with an authorization grant.
- The requesting application uses the authorization grant access specific information.
- On gaining the permission, the app generates an access token.
- The client then uses the access token to access a resource.

### Advantages

- Delegated Access: OAuth 2.0 allows resource owners to delegate access to their resources, ensuring that clients have limited access scopes based on the granted permissions.
- Scalability: OAuth 2.0 is highly scalable due to its token-based nature, making it suitable for large distributed systems and microservices architectures.
- Security: OAuth 2.0 provides a secure way to authenticate users and delegate access without sharing the actual user credentials (username and password).
- Standardization: OAuth 2.0 is a widely accepted standard adopted by many companies and services, promoting interoperability.
- Flexibility: OAuth 2.0 supports multiple flows (grant types) to cater to various client types and scenarios, such as web applications, mobile apps, and single-page applications (SPAs).
- Revocable Access: Tokens issued by OAuth 2.0 can be revoked, allowing resource owners to easily remove access from clients.
- Support for Multiple Use Cases: OAuth 2.0 is versatile and can be used for various use cases, including authentication, authorization, and single sign-on (SSO).
- Third-party Application Access: OAuth 2.0 facilitates third-party application access to user resources without exposing user credentials, promoting the development of secure third-party applications and integrations.

### Disadvantages

- Complexity: Implementing OAuth 2.0 can be complex due to its multiple flows, each catering to different use cases and requiring specific implementations.
- Phishing Vulnerability: Since OAuth 2.0 relies on redirection flows, it can be susceptible to phishing attacks where attackers can mimic the OAuth 2.0 process to capture user credentials.
- Access Token Exposure: Access tokens may be exposed to the client-side, especially in implicit flows used by single-page applications, making them vulnerable to theft.
- Dependency on SSL/TLS: OAuth 2.0 heavily relies on SSL/TLS for security. If SSL/TLS is compromised or poorly implemented, the OAuth 2.0 process can be vulnerable.
- Lack of Built-in Signature Mechanism: OAuth 2.0 does not have a built-in signature mechanism, relying on bearer tokens, which means that anyone who possesses the token can access the resources.
- Limited Guidance on Token Handling: OAuth 2.0 specification provides limited guidance on how to securely handle and store tokens, leaving it up to the implementers.
- Revocation Overhead: Managing and implementing token revocation can add overhead and complexity to the system.
- Potential for Insecure Implementation: Due to its flexibility and multiple flows, there’s a risk of insecure implementations if developers do not fully understand OAuth 2.0 concepts and best practices.
- Mobile Devices Challenges: Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely on mobile devices can be challenging due to the inherent insecurity of these devices and the potential exposure of tokens.

### Types of attacks:

- #### Phishing Attacks

  Attackers create malicious sites or applications that mimic the OAuth 2.0 authorization process, tricking users into revealing their credentials.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker sets up a fake OAuth 2.0 authorization server or client application. Users are tricked into initiating the OAuth 2.0 flow, and their credentials are captured by the attacker.

  _Example:_ A user is directed to a malicious application that requests access to their Google account. The user is redirected to a fake Google login page, where their credentials are captured when they attempt to log in.

- #### Token Hijacking

  Attackers steal OAuth 2.0 tokens, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.

  ##### Mechanism

  Tokens can be intercepted during transmission or stolen from insecure storage or logs.

  _Example:_ An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a mobile application, capturing tokens stored insecurely on the device.

- #### Redirect URI Manipulation

  Attackers manipulate the redirect URI in the authorization request to capture authorization codes.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker modifies the redirect URI to point to a malicious site, capturing authorization codes or tokens sent as query parameters.

  _Example:_ An attacker modifies the redirect URI in a client’s authorization request, capturing the authorization code when the user completes the login process.

- #### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in OAuth 2.0

  Attackers trick users into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated using OAuth 2.0.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker creates malicious links or embeds scripts in webpages to initiate unauthorized OAuth 2.0 authorization requests.

  _Example:_ A user authenticated in a web application is tricked into clicking a link that initiates an unauthorized OAuth 2.0 flow, potentially granting access to a malicious application.

- #### Code Interception Attack

  Attackers intercept authorization codes in the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker intercepts the authorization code by manipulating redirect URIs or through other means, such as network eavesdropping.

  _Example:_ An attacker registers a malicious application with a redirect URI that closely resembles a legitimate application’s URI, capturing authorization codes.

- #### Token Replay Attack

  Attackers reuse tokens to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

  ##### Mechanism

  Captured tokens are replayed in unauthorized requests to access protected resources.

  _Example:_ An attacker captures a token and uses it to access protected resources or APIs, impersonating the legitimate user.

- #### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in OAuth 2.0

  Attackers access objects that they’re not supposed to by manipulating input or request parameters.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker modifies references to gain unauthorized access to other users' resources.

  _Example:_ An attacker modifies the user ID parameter in API requests, accessing another user’s data.

- #### Mix-Up Attack

  Attackers manipulate the OAuth 2.0 flow to confuse the client into using attacker-controlled endpoints.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker interferes with the discovery process or manipulates metadata exchange to control parts of the OAuth 2.0 flow.

  _Example:_ During the discovery process, an attacker manipulates metadata to point to malicious authorization or token endpoints.

- #### Client Impersonation

  Attackers impersonate legitimate OAuth 2.0 clients to gain unauthorized access.

  ##### Mechanism

  The attacker registers a malicious client with characteristics that closely mimic a legitimate client.

  _Example:_ An attacker registers a malicious client with a similar name and logo as a popular application, tricking users into granting access.

### Defense against the attacks:

- Use Well-Known Providers: Only use well-known and trusted OAuth 2.0 providers for authentication.
- Secure Transmission: Always use HTTPS to ensure secure transmission of tokens.
- Token Storage: Store tokens securely, avoiding easily accessible places like local storage.
- Strict Redirect URIs: Only allow specific, predefined redirect URIs.
- Validate Redirect URIs: Ensure that the redirect URIs are validated rigorously against a whitelist.
- State Parameter: Use the state parameter to link client sessions with OAuth 2.0 requests.
- Validate State: Validate the state parameter to ensure that the authorization request originated from the client.
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange): Implement PKCE to protect the authorization code flow, especially for mobile and native applications.
- Token Uniqueness: Ensure that tokens are unique to prevent reuse.
- Token Expiration: Implement short-lived tokens that expire after a brief period.
- Access Control: Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure users can only access objects they are authorized to access.
- Validate User Input: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent unauthorized object references.
- Metadata Validation: Validate metadata rigorously to ensure it originates from trusted sources.
- Manual Configuration: Consider manual configuration of endpoints and keys to avoid relying on automatic discovery.
- Client Authentication: Implement client authentication to ensure that the client is legitimate.
- Client Secret: Use a client secret or other authentication mechanisms to validate the client’s identity.

### Stateless OAuth 2.0 VS Stateful OAuth 2.0

#### Stateless OAuth 2.0:

In a stateless OAuth 2.0 implementation, the server does not keep a record of which tokens are issued. Instead, it issues self-contained tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which include all the necessary information for validation. The server can validate the token by checking its signature and expiration time without needing to store token data on the server.

##### Advantages:

- Reduced server load, as it doesn’t need to query a database to validate tokens.
- Simplifies scaling horizontally because there’s no need for shared state between servers.

##### Disadvantages:

- Revoking tokens can be challenging because the server doesn’t keep a record of issued tokens. However, short token lifetimes and the use of refresh tokens can mitigate this issue.

#### Stateful OAuth 2.0:

In a stateful implementation, the authorization server keeps track of the issued access tokens and refresh tokens. When a resource server receives an access token, it needs to communicate with the authorization server to validate the token.

##### Advantages:

- Tokens can be easily revoked by removing them from the server’s datastore.
- The tokens themselves can be opaque and shorter because they don’t need to contain all the necessary information for validation.

##### Disadvantages:

- Requires more resources on the server-side to manage and validate tokens.
- Scaling requires sharing state between instances of the authorization server.

#### Conclusion:

OAuth 2.0 can be implemented in a stateless or stateful manner, and the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application, such as scalability needs and token revocation requirements.
