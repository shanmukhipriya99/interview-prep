### What is Caching?

The cache is a high-speed storage layer that sits between the application and the original source of the data, such as a database, a file system, or a remote web service. When data is requested by the application, it is first checked in the cache. If the data is found in the cache, it is returned to the application. If the data is not found in the cache, it is retrieved from its original source, stored in the cache for future use, and returned to the application.

### Why do we need `caching`?

The goal of caching is to reduce the number of times data needs to be fetched from its original source, which can result in faster processing and reduced latency.

### What are some ways to implement `caching`?

- `In-memory caching` stores data in the main memory of the computer, which is faster to access than disk storage.
- `Disk caching` stores data on the hard disk, which is slower than main memory but faster than retrieving data from a remote source.
- `Database caching` stores frequently accessed data in the database itself, reducing the need to access external storage.
- `CDN caching` stores data on a distributed network of servers, reducing the latency of accessing data from remote locations.

### What is `Cache`?

A temporary storage location for data or computation results, typically designed for fast access and retrieval.

### What is `Cache Hit`?

When a requested data item or computation result is found in the cache.

### What is `Cache Miss`?

When a requested data item or computation result is not found in the cache and needs to be fetched from the original data source or recalculated.

### What is `Cache Eviction`?

The process of removing data from the cache, typically to make room for new data or based on a predefined cache eviction policy.

### What is `Cache Staleness`?

When the data in the cache is outdated compared to the original data source.

### Why is `caching` important?

- #### _Reduced latency_

  By serving data from the cache, which is typically faster to access than the original data source, caching can significantly reduce the time it takes to retrieve the data.

- #### _Improved system performance_

  Caching can significantly improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times data needs to be fetched from its original source. Since cached data can be retrieved faster than from the original source, this results in a significant reduction in processing time, which leads to a more responsive application.

- #### _Reduced network load_

  Caching can also reduce network load by minimizing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network. Since cached data is stored locally, there is no need to fetch data from the original source, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

- #### _Increased scalability_

  Caching can improve the scalability of an application by reducing the load on the original source. By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, the original source is less likely to be overwhelmed with requests, making it more scalable.

- #### _Better user experience_
  Faster response times and reduced latency can lead to a better user experience. Applications that load quickly and respond to user requests in a timely manner are more likely to be used and preferred by users.
